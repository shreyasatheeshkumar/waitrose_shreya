# waitrose_shreya
Data Engineering Project
This script is designed to automatically identify and collect all CSV files from a specific directory (../data/waitrose) using Python.
Instead of manually specifying file names, the program dynamically scans the folder, filters only .csv files, and stores their complete file paths in a list.
This approach is highly useful in real-world data analysis projects where multiple CSV files are generated or updated frequently.
By automating file collection,the code improves efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.
